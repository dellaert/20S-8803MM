# Visual Odometry

* {% include DK.md %} Chapter 2 covers visual odometry and SLAM.
* There was a [nice tutorial at CVPR 2014 on VO and SLAM](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kaess/vslam_cvpr14/) with many good slide decks.
* [Raquel Urtasun's lecture slides](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~urtasun/courses/CSC2541/03_odometry.pdf) are a nice more in-depth resource.

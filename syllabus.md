## Syllabus

### Class Goals
The desired learning outcome is that, given a mobile manipulation application and a hardware platform, the students that have taken the class will be able to build a software architecture that, when executed on the hardware, constitutes a working prototype for the desired application.

### Prerequisites
This is a graduate class with a cross-listed undergraduate section. For undergrads there is a 3630 pre-requisite. While there are no pre-requisites for graduate students, we will go rather quickly over basic concepts, and you will have to pick up the slack on your own time if you don’t have the background, e.g., by studying Peter Corke’s excellent book (which FD used in 3630). Good programming and math skills, esp. linear algebra, are essential.

### Text
We will often be referring to papers rather than books. However, the following book from 3630 is a handy reference: Robotics, Vision & Control, Peter Corke, Springer (see its webpage for links).

### Structure and Sequence of Class Activities
There will be a mix of conventional lectures, in-class presentations of research papers by students, and reviewing activities related to the final project (see below).

### Out-of-class Work
There are several activities designed to achieve the learning outcomes above:
* Reading and understanding research papers: I will assign papers to read, and mini assignments associated with them to help you parse the relevant concepts from them.
* Foundational assignments: there will be 6 assignments on foundational material that will have a substantial ROS (Robot Operating System) component, some in simulation, others on the Fetch Robotics platform that we will use as a prototypical mobile manipulation platform.
* Final project: the assignments are designed to build and get familiar with individual robot perception, planning, and manipulation skills. In a final project you will put these different skills together in a layered software architecture to build a fully integrated, operational MM system. The final design is to be demonstrated and reported in a conference style manuscript.
* Assessment: At the end of the course, there will be a final exam, but you will be given the questions in advance, some time after each lecture. This will allow you to reflect on the lectures on a regular basis, as well as thinking back on the entire course near final exam time.

### Schedule
A detailed schedule, subject to change, can be found on the [schedule page](schedule.md).

### Grading
* Class Participation and in-class presentations: 10%
* [Projects](projects.md): 60%
* Final Project: 20%
* Final Exam: 10%

Late policy for this course will be 12% per day late, pro-rated per hour.

### Learning Accommodations
If needed, we will make classroom accommodations for students with documented disabilities. These accommodations must be arranged in advance and in accordance with the ADAPTS office (www.adapts.gatech.edu).

### Important Links:
* [Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/k4cz17x06xx788). This should be your first stop for questions and announcements.
* [canvas.gatech.edu](https://canvas.gatech.edu/) will be used to hand in assignments.

### Contact Info and Office Hours:
If possible, please use Piazza to ask questions and seek clarifications before emailing the instructor or staff.
* Ria Verma

### Academic Integrity
Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. This includes cheating, lying about course matters, plagiarism, or helping others commit a violation of the Honor Code. Plagiarism includes reproducing the words of others without both the use of quotation marks and citation. Students are reminded of the obligations and expectations associated with the Georgia Tech Academic Honor Code and Student Code of Conduct, available online at www.honor.gatech.edu. For quizzes, no supporting materials are allowed (notes, calculators, phones, etc).

You are expected to implement the core components of each project on your own, but the extra credit opportunties often build on third party data sets or code. That's fine. Feel free to include results built on other software, as long as you are clear in your handin that it is not your own work.

You should not view or edit anyone else's code. You should not post code to Piazza, except for starter code / helper code that isn't related to the core project.

Unless group work is explicitly part of the class work, collaboration on individual assignments is encouraged at the "white board interaction" level. That is, share ideas and technical conversation, but write your own code. Students are expected to abide by the Georgia Tech Honor Code. Honest and ethical behavior is expected at all times. All incidents of suspected dishonesty will be reported to and handled by the office of student affairs.

### Acknowledgements
The materials from this class rely significantly on slides prepared by other instructors. Each slide set and assignment contains acknowledgements. Feel free to use these slides for academic or research purposes, but please maintain all acknowledgements.

# Bayes nets

{% include DK.md %} Chapter 1 has a good overview of how Bayes nets and factor graphs relate to inference in robotics.

The following are introductory notes Frank used in CS 3630:
* [3630: Probabilityand Bayes Nets](https://dellaert.github.io/20S-3630/notes/1-Bayes-nets.pdf)
* [3630: Inference in Graphical Models](https://dellaert.github.io/20S-3630/notes/1-hmm-inference.pdf)

Here are some more introductory resources on the web:
* [Bayes nets without tears](https://aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/view/918)
* [Some lecture notes from UCF](http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~mingjie/ECM6308/rand0.pdf)
